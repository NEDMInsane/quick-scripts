"int main(void)" - main function
    - int - returning an integer
    - void - takes no arguments

Readable and understadable code is best.

Scope:
	Objects, Functions, Macros, and other C Language Identifiers all have scopes that
	delimit the contiguous region. C has four types of scope:
		- File - the entire text file, and any files included after that.
		- Block - meaning the scope is contained the block where it is decalred.
		- Function Prototype - the list of paramaters for a Function.
		- Function - contained within the {} of a function.
	
Storage Duration:
	Objects have storage duration that determines their lifetime. There are four durations
	availible for C:
		- Automatic - Declared in a block or as a function parameter
		- Static - Decalred in File scope, storage as long as you are using the file
		- Thread - Used in concurrent programming
		- Allocated - Dynamically allocated memory

Character Types:
	Char- Represent the minimum set of characters required, upper and lowercase letters, 10 decimal
		digits, the space cahracter, punctuation, and control characters.
	Signed Char - Safer to represent small signed integer values
	Unsigned Char - Represent small unsigned values
	wchar_t - Wide Char that accepts some non-English letters

Numerical Types:
	Integer Types:
		Signed integer types - can be used to represent negative numbers, positive numbers and
		numbers, and zero. 'signed char', 'short int', 'int', 'long int', and 'long long int'


declaring variables:
	integers - int a = 1
		 - int a
		 - int a, b, c decalring multiple on a line can get confusing.

char - character - a single byte
short - short integer
long - long integer
double - double-percision floeating point	
	

integer division truncates the fractional part. 2/5 would = 0 instead of 0.4.

in a loop you do not need curly brackets if the loop onyl contains one statement.
